**Your coding window should look the way you like.**

One image becomes one theme. After install, switching skins is a single click in the top menu, and one click restores the official UI.

## What it is

A local skin switcher for OpenAI Codex Desktop. It injects themes at runtime through loopback Chrome DevTools Protocol (`127.0.0.1:9341`) and never modifies `app.asar`, application binaries, or signature resources. Sidebar, suggestion cards, and the composer stay fully native and interactive.

- **One-click switching**: a 🎨 menu appears at the top of Codex; every installed theme and the native UI switch instantly, with light/dark appearance synced automatically.
- **One image, one theme**: any PNG, JPG, JPEG, or WebP becomes a full skin (palette + backdrop).
- **AI-generated themes**: hand `output/heige-codex-skin-studio.skill` to Codex and say "generate a cyberpunk hero image, then turn it into a skin". No extra API key needed.
- **10 built-in presets**: the high-detail `Miku 488137`, two lightweight themes each for Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves, Naruto, and Love and Deepspace, plus one easter-egg preset.
- **Optional pet**: the package ships an independent `Miku Future` animated desktop pet. Installing it is your call.
- **User-controlled persistence**: the top-menu switch is the only supported way to enable next-launch persistence. Turning it off keeps the current session skinned and restores the native UI on the next launch.

## Quick start

macOS (requires an installed Codex Desktop):

```bash
open "<repo-path>/scripts/install.command"
```

Windows: run `scripts\windows\install.bat`, then use `scripts/windows/apply.ps1`, the session-only compatibility entry `scripts/windows/enable-skin.bat`, `scripts/windows/pause.ps1`, `scripts/windows/resume.ps1`, and `scripts/windows/restore.ps1`. Microsoft Store/MSIX activation is implemented but still pending live-machine validation.

Applying a skin quits Codex normally and relaunches it with a local debug port, so save your work first. A system Node runtime must be Node.js 22 or newer.

## Make your own theme

1. Upload any image through the 🎨 menu ("＋ 自定义图片"): colors and appearance are picked automatically. This slot is a single local quick slot, not a durable distributable theme.
2. Run `customize.command` to turn an image into a full saved theme.
3. Give the `.skill` package to Codex and let it generate the artwork and build the theme end to end.

Ready-to-copy image prompts live in the [theme prompt gallery](docs/theme-prompts.md) (Chinese). Share your results in the [showcase discussions](https://github.com/HeiGeAi/heige-codex-skin-studio/discussions).

## Honest notes

- Loopback CDP is unauthenticated; local same-user processes remain inside the threat boundary. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- macOS has dated live-machine evidence. Windows is covered by cross-PowerShell automation, while Microsoft Store/MSIX remains pending live validation.
- Future Codex Desktop changes to startup arguments, renderer structure, or selectors may require adaptation.
- Full manual (CLI, theme JSON schema, persistence semantics, FAQ): [docs/manual.md](docs/manual.md) (Chinese).
